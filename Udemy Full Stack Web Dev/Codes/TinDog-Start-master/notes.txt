# BOOTSTRAP GRIDS

Grids are made up of 12 parts in one row
<div class = "row">
    <div clas = "col">
    <div>
</div>

By default it will take all 12 parts, we can change that using (lg/md/sm)-(number of parts we want it to take)

so lg-3 means it will take 3 parts i.e 4 divs will be visible on large screen
so md-6 means it will take 6 parts i.e 2 divs will be visible on medium screen
so sm-12 means it will take 12 parts i.e 1 div will be visible on small screen

However by default it takes the entire width, so sm-12 is not necessary

This is how you can make the website responsive using BOOTSTRAP


# BOOTSTRAP CONTAINER

A container is again a layout manager in bootsrap which helps to style all the content inside with padding margings etc.
A default container will take up some of the the width (more than half) and will jump to lower widths as width of the viewport decreases
A fluid container however will take up all the width and will smoothly adapt to the screen size

<div class = "container>
content
</div>
<div class = "container-fluid>
content
</div>

Then we can target container/container-fluid in css and apply our own padding and styles
